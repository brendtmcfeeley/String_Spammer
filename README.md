# String_Spammer

Have you ever wanted to spam a string in Discord or even Slack?

Just use this script and copy paste the output into the messaging service of your choice. :^)
Disclaimer: It only takes the last letter of the string to spam.

Have fun annoying your friends!

How to use :

1) Clone / download the script to wherever you desire
2) cd into the directory
3) Run the script using python 2 / 3

```
python3 string_spammer.py <arg1> <arg2>
```

Arg1 is the desired string you want to spam.

Arg2 (Optional) is the character limit of the program you want to spam it in.
  - If no limit is specified, the program will default on a 1000 character limit.

4) Copy and paste the output from your console
